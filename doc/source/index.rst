 oslo.versionedobjects
=======================

The oslo.versionedobjects library provides a generic versioned object model
that is RPC-friendly, with inbuilt serialization, field typing, and remotable
method calls. It can be used to define a data model within a project
independent of external APIs or database schema for the purposes of providing
upgrade compatibility across distributed services.
